        "**1. Hyperplane:**\n",
        "In an SVM, the hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates the data points of different classes. In two-dimensional space, it's a line, but in higher dimensions, it becomes a plane or a hyperplane.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Support Vectors:**\n",
        "These are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane. They are critical in defining the position and orientation of the hyperplane. The support vectors are the most challenging cases and are used to maximize the margin of the classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Margin:**\n",
        "This is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vectors from either class. SVM aims to maximize this margin, providing the best separation between classes. A larger margin often leads to better generalization on unseen data."
