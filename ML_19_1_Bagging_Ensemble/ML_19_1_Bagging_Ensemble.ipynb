        "* Bagging works by creating samples of the training dataset and fitting a decision tree on each sample.\n",
        "* The differences in the training datasets result in differences in the fit decision trees, and in turn, differences in predictions made by those trees.\n",
        "* The predictions made by the ensemble members are then combined using simple statistics, such as **voting or averaging.**\n",
        "* Key to the method is the manner in which each sample of the dataset is prepared to train ensemble members.\n",
        "* Examples (rows) are drawn from the dataset at random, although with replacement.\n",
        "* Replacement means that if a row is selected, it is returned to the training dataset for potential re-selection in the same training dataset.\n",
        "* This is called a **bootstrap sample,** giving the technique its name.\n",

        "**Bagging** is available in scikit-learn via the **BaggingClassifier** and **BaggingRegressor classes,** which use a decision tree as the base-model by default and you can specify the number of trees to create via the **n estimators** argument."
